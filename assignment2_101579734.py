    # Q3: What is the benefit of using @property and @target.setter?
    # Using @property and @target.setter lets the program control how the target value is accessed and changed.
    # This is better than changing self.__target directly because validation can be added before assigning a new value.
    # In this program, it helps prevent an empty target from being saved by mistake.

# Q1: How does PortScanner reuse code from NetworkTool?
# PortScanner reuses code from NetworkTool by inheriting from it.
# For example, PortScanner uses the target property, setter, and constructor behavior from the parent class instead of rewriting them.
# This makes the code shorter and keeps shared functionality in one place.

        # Q4: What would happen without try-except here?
        # Without try-except, a socket error on an unreachable machine could stop the whole program.
        # That means one failed connection could crash the scan before the other ports are checked.
        # Using try-except makes the scanner more reliable and allows it to continue scanning.

    # Q2: Why do we use threading instead of scanning one port at a time?
    # Threading makes the scan faster because multiple ports can be checked at the same time.

    # Using threads improves performance and makes the scanner more practical.

# Q5: New Feature Proposal
# One extra feature I would add is a filter option that shows only ports for a specific status or service name.
# This could use a list comprehension to quickly build a smaller list from the scan results, such as only Open ports or only HTTP-related ports.
