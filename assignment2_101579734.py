    # This helps prevent mistakes and keeps the program more stable.

# PortScanner reuses code by inheriting from NetworkTool.
# It uses the target variable and methods like the constructor without rewriting them.
# For example, the target property is already defined in the parent class.

# Q5: New Feature Proposal
# One feature I would add is the ability to filter results by service name.
# This could use a list comprehension to return only ports matching something like "HTTP".
# It would make it easier to focus on specific services instead of all scan results.
